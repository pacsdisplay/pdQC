#  A pacsDisplay TCL script commands to determine directory paths that
#  are common to programs in the pacsDisplay package.
#  This is typically sourced at the beginning within a config file.
#
#  It is assumed that the program is executed in a subdirectory,
#       ../programName/program.exe
#  .. where .. is either the installation or the development folder.
#  For programs that have been installed with the pacsDisplay
#  installer, a file will exist in .. called LUTsDir.txt
#  that has the path to the directory with the LUTs and LOGs directories.
#
#  The following global variables are define
#      userDir       : Path to the LUTs and LOGs directory
#      logDir        : Path to _LOTgs where log files are written
#      lumFilePath   : Path to _NEW directory for saving uLR/cLR files
#      LIB           : Path to LIB in where common programs are stored
#      gnuplot       : Path to the gnuplot executable in LIB.
